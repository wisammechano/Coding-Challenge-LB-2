# Find and Fix Errors
## _No. of errors in HTML & CSS: **10**_

_A web developer was working on a simple website for Re:Coded bootcamps_


**This simple web page was designed to look like this before the JS part applied:**

**And like this after JS part applied:**

_But one day, the son of the developer took a hold of the keyboard, made some random HTML and CSS errors, disabled the buttons functionality, asked some questions, and demanded some tasks TODO._


**Your task is:**
- Check the HTML & CSS code in the files: `index.html` and `style.css` for errors, fix as much as you can to make it appear like the screenshots above, 
- Answer the son's questions in the file: `Questions.md`. The file is in a markdown format, you can look for the `Q:` sign and answer after the `A:` sign.
- Do the demanded tasks by following the `@TODO` directives. You can search for @TODO in the html & css files and do the required task.
- Add the resources you used to the file: `resources.md`, i.e. add the link you found in Google to your question, or type asked a friend if a friend helped you answering it.
- Add the JavaScript code to make the buttons work to the html file!
- If you get stuck on one of the requirements, skip it and do other ones, then come back to it at the end.
- If you can't answer a question, try to provide an explanation with why you couldn't determine the answer. 


> _You might need to **add more** HTML elements and/or CSS rules._

> You are **required to add** as much JavaScript code as you can.
